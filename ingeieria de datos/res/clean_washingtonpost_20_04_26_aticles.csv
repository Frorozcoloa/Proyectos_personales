cbd02f272a424b5fa771368b6c48ff26,These photos explore how rising sea levels are affecting Miami,"    From FloodZone by Anastasia Samoylova, published by Steidl, 2020. (Anastasia Samoylova/Steidl)       By   Kenneth Dickerman and          Kenneth Dickerman Photo editor  Email  Bio       Anastasia Samoylova     April 24  Anastasia Samoylovas book, FloodZone (2020, Steidl), is a collection of beautifully seen images about an impending catastrophe. Four years ago, Samoylova moved to Miami during the citys hottest summer on record. It was the first time she had lived in a coastal environment. One of the first things Samoylova began to notice was the dissonance between the citys booming real estate market and the reality of the oceans rising water levels, making their way toward the very places being developed. As Samoylova says in her book: Last 3 years brought 3 hurricanes to the shore, yet no substantial measures have been taken to address the issue besides the individual efforts to prepare for and retreat during the storms. Water views are prized in the real estate world, with little regard for building projects locations in high-risk flood zones. Investors seem to turn a blind eye to the reality that places like Miami are steadily slipping underwater. Living in Miami is bittersweet: it looks and feels like a paradise, but the only secure roots belong to mangrove trees.  As the world warms, the seas rise. This is the result of climate change, which is a hot-button issue for many. On one side, you have scientists sounding the alarm, while on the other side, you have people who think the whole thing is overblown. As recently as May 2019, The Washington Posts editorial board warned that scientists have said the problem of rising water levels may be even worse than thought. Coastal cities nationwide are grappling with ways to stave off the worst of the impact, Miami included. Samoylovas book is an eloquent reminder of the stakes before us. The photos in the book are at once beautiful and foreboding. The iconic pastels of Miami are intermingled with scenes of water erosion, rusted-out hulks of boats and aerial views showing how the city is surrounded by encroaching water. Heres how Samoylova sums up the goal of FloodZone: It was not until Hurricane Irma, which hit Miami in 2017, that I understood the urgency in documenting places that are getting transformed by this already acutely felt outcome of climate change, flooding. From aerial photography to close-up observations of buildings, flora and fauna, my goal is to provide a broad yet focused perspective of what it feels like to live in these at-risk areas while the development continues to bring profit and a sense of denial appears to be instilled by external forces. You can find out more about Samoylova and her work here.

(Kevin D. Liles for The Washington Post)       By   Reis Thebault ,          Reis Thebault National and breaking news reporter  Email  Bio  Follow         Andrew Ba Tran and          Andrew Ba Tran Data reporter on the rapid-response investigative team  Email  Bio  Follow         Vanessa Williams          Vanessa Williams Reporter on the National desk.   Email  Bio  Follow         April 26 at 12:21 PM  Sheryl Means already has lost so much to the invisible virus burning through her hometown. Her mother and her aunt died within days of each other. Her sister has been on a ventilator for weeks in a hospital miles away, and there are no visitors allowed in the covid-19 isolation unit. She has this tightness in her chest, and shes scared she might be next. But Means cant get a test. Even now, six weeks into a national emergency, with the death toll still climbing in southwest Georgia, and her kin sick from the novel coronavirus. Even though, as a home health-care worker, shes at high risk for exposure. She isnt displaying enough symptoms to get the required doctors referral. If she wanted, though, she could get her hair and nails done, since the states governor invited some businesses to reopen Friday, despite local leaders, public health experts and residents like Means insisting Georgia isnt ready.. They fear the restart will spike new infections, particularly in the southwest region, with some of the highest death rates in the nation. In these small, interconnected towns, where everyone seems to know everyone else, each death reverberates. Its crazy to open these businesses, said Means, a 51-year-old Damascus resident. Which do you want us to do: Be safe or be sorry? Live or die?  [Sign up for our Coronavirus Updates newsletter to track the outbreak. All stories linked in the newsletter are free to access.] Of the 20 counties in the nation with the most deaths per capita from covid-19, the disease caused by the coronavirus, five are in southwest Georgia, including Early, where Means lives. In the states hardest-hit places, African Americans make up most of the population, and about 30 percent of residents live in poverty. Theyve struggled for years with a severe lack of access to health care. Some counties have no doctors, no hospitals and a high percentage of uninsured residents. The facilities and physicians already were stretched thin.    A shuttered downtown Albany may soon exhibit signs of life as restrictions on some businesses are lifted. (Kevin D. Liles for The Washington Post)  Then came the coronavirus, fast-moving and super-infectious, preying on the elderly and those with underlying health problems  perfectly primed to devastate a vulnerable population. When Gov. Brian Kemp (R) announced he was lifting restrictions on businesses, some residents in this region felt cast off, like the state was telling them to fend for themselves once again. To open up businesses where its impossible to practice social distancing  hair salons, nail salons, theaters  people are like, what? You want to put everybody in a closed room, and thats supposed to be okay? said Demetrius Young, a city commissioner in Albany, the center of the states epidemic. For black folks, its like a setup: Are you trying to kill us?   Without a widespread testing infrastructure and local health departments able to do meticulous contact tracing, Young said, his region will continue to suffer. Georgia ranks 40th in tests per resident, well behind states that have pledged to maintain their shelter-in-place orders, according to an analysis of Covid Tracking Project data. Some models say the state has not yet reached its peak number of daily deaths, suggesting the worst is still to come.   #g-CumulativeGA-box{max-width:720px}#g-CumulativeGA-box,#g-CumulativeGA-box

He said he doesnt plan to reopen them on Monday, when Kemps order for restarting the economy extends to restaurants. He is not convinced the virus has been brought under control, especially in Southwest Georgia. We were hit hard, and our restraint needs to be harder. We have to make sure were way beyond the curve, he said. He hasnt had time to come up with a plan, such as how to screen customers, to make sure he can keep everyone, including his employees and family members who work in the restaurants, safe. My wife, my sons, my granddaughters are in there. My employees. These are folks we love. I cant play with their lives. Were a small town.

Liles for The Washington Post)  Through Friday, African Americans accounted for more than 50 percent of Georgias deaths, despite making up about 30 percent of the states 10.6 million people. The toll is far greater in less populous counties where the largest share of residents is black. The number of cases per capita in plurality-black counties is 1.75 times that of plurality-white counties. The number of deaths per capita in plurality-black counties is twice that of white counties. There are signs the viruss spread is picking up pace in white communities, too, though the mostly black neighborhoods are still seeing the highest number of cases per capita, according to an analysis of Census block-level data scraped from documents on Georgias Department of Public Health website. [Covid-19 is killing black Americans at an alarmingly high rate, Post analysis shows] These disparities illuminate a deep racial inequality: In Georgia, where Kemp has resisted Medicaid expansion, African Americans are less likely to be insured and more likely to have preexisting health conditions like diabetes, said Ben Lopman, a professor of epidemiology at Emory University. Theyre also more likely to work in industries with a greater risk of exposure such as transportation, nursing homes and animal-slaughter plants  like the still-operating Tyson Foods plant in Mitchell County, where four infected workers have died. In the South, weve seen these kinds of inequalities in health for a long time, Lopman said, comparing the pattern to the AIDS epidemic. These inequalities are being repeated again for covid.    Apartments and a mostly empty street near downtown Albany. (Kevin D. Liles for The Washington Post)  States from Wisconsin to Louisiana are seeing disproportionate numbers as well, but the disparity in Georgia is also geographic. Across the United States, urban counties have higher rates of coronavirus cases and deaths than rural counties. In Georgia, its the opposite. The states rural areas have a death rate 1.5 times that of its large cities. Is this an indicator of what were going to see throughout the country? Absolutely, Andrew T. Pavia, head of the pediatric infectious diseases division at the University of Utah School of Medicine, said of rural Georgia at an Infectious Diseases Society of America briefing this week. Its a perfect storm for risk of death when the virus lands in these poor, more rural communities. The resources to fight an epidemic like this  ventilators, intensive care facilities, infectious disease experts, doctors in general  are overwhelmingly concentrated in cities, Pavia said, making rural areas particularly vulnerable.

setup:window.setupInteractive||window.getComponent});   Many of the southwest Georgia counties with the highest death rates have no hospitals. Unlike smaller cities and towns in northern Georgia, which are closer to Atlanta and have easy access to more than one regional medical center, residents in the southwest are forced to travel to Albany, the areas hub, or to neighboring Alabama or Florida. Monty Veazey, president and CEO of the Georgia Alliance of Community Hospitals, described the dire situation in the states rural communities, including the southwest: Nine counties have no doctors  none, zero  18 counties without family physicians, 32 have no internists, 60 without pediatricians, 76 counties have no OB/GYNs. At least seven rural hospitals in Georgia have closed during the past decade. Amid the outbreak, many doctors have shuttered their offices and are consulting with patients online. But vast swaths of rural Georgia do not have Internet access, further limiting residents ability to seek care.    Aisha Bennett, a nurse at Emory Hospital, takes a nasal swab on April 16 at a drive-through testing site for covid-19 at the Georgia International Horse Park in Conyers. (Curtis Compton/Atlanta Journal-Constitution/AP)  Federally funded community health centers fill in the gaps in some rural counties, but Veazey said of the nearly 30 counties that make up southwest Georgia, only a handful have those centers. Even those facilities are out of reach for some residents because they charge at least a nominal fee for care. Veazeys association represents not-for-profit hospitals, and he is concerned some might not survive the pandemic, having halted the elective procedures that typically generate revenue. Hospital closures would mean less access for residents and fewer jobs, contributing to the regions economic distress. In Cuthbert, Mayor Steve Whatley is worried about the fate of the only hospital in Randolph County, Southwest Georgia Regional Medical Center. His countys outbreak began in a nursing home, where 43 of its 60 residents have tested positive and are quarantined in the facility. The other 17 were transferred to the hospital, which is straining to take care of them. The crisis has really impacted our hospital financially, he said. I cannot tell you what its done to us. Were bleeding money. State Sen. Dean Burke, a Republican who supports Kemps decision to begin reopening businesses, said the coronavirus has shown the importance of a well-funded rural health-care system. Burke, who is also the chief medical officer at a hospital in Decatur, a southwest county that mostly has been spared, said facilities like his will need more financial support from the state and federal governments.    Qaadir Larke, wearing a gas mask, gives Brandon Lewis a haircut April 24 at his barbershop, The Quad, in Atlanta. (Kevin D. Liles for The Washington Post)  I think we will, after this is all over, come to understand the importance of a rural health network and the fact we cant just let the big cities have big medical facilities and let rural facilities die on the vine, Burke said. I do think there will be a new appreciation that we have to use more resources to stabilize our rural health care network. In the absence of robust testing and official contact tracing, residents have used an informal grapevine to form their own theories about how the virus spread: Some attendees of an early March birthday party in Blakely, the seat of Early County, were among the first to fall ill. But most believe the regions outbreak began at a Dougherty County funeral in February that drew more than 100 mourners, including a man from Atlanta who died a few days after the services. The virus spread from there, quickly overwhelming Albany, the county seat, and radiating to neighboring locales. The county has nearly 1,500 cases and 108 deaths, a toll outnumbering everywhere else in Georgia  even Fulton County, home to Atlanta, where the population is 10 times that of Dougherty.

window.getComponent});   Most of those victims have died at Phoebe Putney Memorial, the countys only hospital. The facilitys administrators say theyve seen significant progress in slowing the spread of the coronavirus, but theyre concerned a reopened Georgia will bring another tide of patients. While we have successfully slowed the rate of covid-19 transmission in our area, we know there are still significant numbers of covid-positive individuals in our community, Scott Steiner, the hospital CEO, said in a statement the day after Kemps announcement. We worry that if people start returning to large gatherings too soon, we could see another super-spreader event where a lot of people contract the virus. We certainly dont want that to happen."" U.S. Rep. Sanford D. Bishop Jr., a Democrat who represents southwest Georgia, said he has worked with state and local officials to get additional resources for Phoebe Putney, including a drive-up testing site. He said the relief package passed this week by Congress will provide money for additional testing, in addition to economic relief for residents and businesses.    Phoebe Putney Memorial Hospital in downtown Albany may receive funding for additional testing for the coronavirus from a relief package passed by Congress. (Kevin D. Liles for The Washington Post)  Weve had a really, really bad experience in southwest Georgia, Bishop said. Unfortunately, its a result of the fact that a lot of people  some 500,000 people in Georgia  are not covered by Medicaid, so they do not get regular preventive care and have a lot of preexisting conditions that lend themselves to attack by coronavirus. Even as the state reported more cases and deaths in the days leading up to its reopening, Kemp defended his decision as one bolstered by data and public health recommendations. We remain focused on protecting the lives  and livelihoods  of all Georgians, Kemp wrote on Twitter. Now, with favorable data and approval from state health officials, we are taking another measured step forward by opening shuttered businesses for limited operations, he added. Kemps office did not respond to questions about his decision and its impact on the states southwest.        In Blakely, a city of about 5,000 near Alabama, Mayor Travis Wimbush  who tested positive for covid-19  has streamed regular addresses to his residents on Facebook, imploring them to stay home. I will not put the power of a dollar over the value of a life in any decision that I will make, he said on Wednesday. There are currently still citizens of Blakely on life support. In Damascus, Means is still mourning. Her aunt, 83-year-old Rosetta Salter, died April 3, two days before test results confirmed she had covid-19. Meanss mother, Bernice McCray, 80, was in a nursing home when she ran a fever. She was at a hospital in Dothan, Ala., where the family was allowed to visit only to say their goodbyes two days before she died April 9. Means doesnt know how her sister got infected but suspects it was in Albany. She was first diagnosed with pneumonia, then tested positive for covid-19 and was transferred to Dothan. Means hasnt seen her since. Because Means hasnt displayed symptoms other than chest tightness since her family members were diagnosed, her doctor, whom she sees regularly for her diabetes, said there was no need to be tested. She was probably just stressed. She told him she couldnt rest until she knew. The doctor sent her to Thomasville, over an hours drive, where a county-run drive-up site tests patients free without a referral. Means arrived early Thursday morning. She didnt have a fever, cough or shortness of breath, so the nurse there wouldnt test her. She blamed stress, just like Means doctor had. The nurses message: Dont you go bothering yourself about the coronavirus now.    An uplifting message from reggae pioneer Bob Marley appears on a theater marquee in downtown Albany. (Kevin D.

4ce6a0d1171f3a353817cbcc68d6ecaa,"How to secure a refund for a flight canceled due to coronavirus, according to the experts"," In the months the coronavirus outbreak has spread around the world, the Department of Transportation noticed another uptick: an increasing number of Americans being denied their rights to airfare refunds. The Department has received a high volume of complaints on air travel matters related to the COVID-19 public health emergency, a DOT spokesperson told The Washington Post in an email. Many of these complaints concern lack of refunds, assessment of change fees, and inability to reach an airline representative. Before the coronavirus pandemic took a major toll on travel, the DOT had a rule in place that if an airline cancels a flight, it must provide ticket-holders with a cash refund for the airfare and fees. (Note that if a traveler cancels their own ticket, theres no rule or guarantee for a refund.) [Follow all of our coronavirus coverage.] But as people were told to stay home to flatten the curve, travel restrictions were issued and nonessential travel was all but banned, airlines stopped following this DOT regulation, according to the complaints received by the agency, tweets from customers and industry insiders. On Friday, the DOT issued an enforcement notice to airlines that even during this pandemic, U.S. and foreign airlines must give customers a cash refund if a flight to, within, or from the United States is canceled or has a significant schedule change. For people still struggling to get a refund, industry experts told us their advice. [Sign up for our Coronavirus Updates newsletter to track the outbreak. All stories linked in the newsletter are free to access.] [The latest flexible policies at major airlines in the wake of coronavirus] Call the airline Travelers who were stonewalled by airlines in recent weeks may have a different result when calling back after that latest DOT enforcement notice. Everybody should be able to get their cash refunds, says Charles Leocha, the president and co-founder of the advocacy group Travelers United. They paid for something. Theyre not getting it. Its basic American law. For those who were given a flight credit for a cancellation and would like their money back instead, airlines are also required to honor that request. In that [DOT] memo, they said at the end that the airlines should now contact everyone whose arm they twisted into taking credit and inform them that they have their choice, Leocha says. They can now get cash back, or they can leave the credit in place. [As covid-19 cases mount, flight attendants grow increasingly fearful of flying] Call the airline again As the saying goes, if at first you dont succeed, try, try again. First, politely say, Thank you, appreciate your time. Hang up. Call again, says Scott Keyes, founder of Scotts Cheap Flights. The reason why is that airline agents have a lot of discretion about which refunds they process. So oftentimes, its not as though theres a blanket policy, and youll never get one agent to treat you differently than another. Keyes says that although youre unlikely to change one agents mind, you could have better luck with one of the thousands of other agents taking customer calls. I cant tell you the number of times and Ive been told no on the first call, no on the second call, then yes on the third call, he says. Make sure to be nice when calling agents. Not only is it a stressful time for everyone right now, but its also in a callers best interest. I would always be very nice, because if youre a jerk, they put a note in your record, Leocha says. Contact your credit-card company Keyes says that when all else fails, enlist the help of credit-card companies. Card protections are in place for these very reasons. Every credit card and bank has a process where you can dispute a charge if youve paid for something and you didnt receive that service, Keyes says. So if you paid for a flight, and the airline canceled the flight, they are not allowed to hold your money hostage. Keyes uses this step as a last resort, because the process can be more of a bureaucracy hassle than going to the airline directly. [Airline industry seeking more than $50 billion in government aid amid coronavirus crisis] File a complaint with the DOT Report issues with airlines directly to the DOT through the agencys website. The Department maintains an aviation consumer protection website that provides useful information about passenger rights, including issues related to flight delays, cancellations, and refunds, the DOT spokesperson said. The website also has an online complaint form so that air travelers can quickly and easily file a complaint with the Department. Both Leocha and Keyes recommend filing a complaint with the DOT. If the airlines refuse to [issue a refund], get the persons name, and get it in writing, Leocha says. Say, Send me in writing that you refuse. Then its very important to complain to the DOT. Filing a complaint isnt about blowing off steam. It can be good for both the traveler and the entire traveling community. The fact that the Department of Transportation put out the directive they did on Friday, I think is directly attributable to the hundreds or thousands of complaints that people were filing because the airlines were behaving so poorly, Keyes says.

An orangutan? A Gentoo penguin? Nope, its just a squirrel. For animal lovers, the neighborhood wildlife might not be as exciting as the more exotic creatures that live in zoos and aquariums. Although their doors are temporarily closed, you can take a peek behind the gates and observe the animals through live streams captured by video cameras set up in enclosures and tanks. Maybe youve never seen a walrus before, so you could watch for a while and realize that even though theyre a little awkward on land, they are very graceful in the water, said Carla Knapp, who works for the Indianapolis Zoo. Or perhaps after a few days of watching our tigers, you may notice that theyre all drawn to the same tree or rock. Thats because they can smell the other tiger that was there a couple days ago. With the live footage, each episode is different. Maybe you will see the animals playing or snacking or sleeping. (Dont be alarmed if there are no animals on view. It just means they have disappeared into a private area or a staff member was not available to move the camera.) Here are a few animal cams you should tune into:    African penguins on exhibit in the Splash Zone at Monterey Bay Aquarium in Monterey, California. The aquarium, which is also closed to visitors, has nine animal and habitat cams for virtual visits. (Monterey Bay Aquarium)   Marine life  Option 1: Monterey Bay Aquarium in California has nine viewing options for animals (sharks and penguins, for example) and aquatic environments (kelp forest, coral reef). You can watch the sea otters dart through the water like Olympic swimmers or bob along with the moon jellies and sea nettles as they perform their ghostly dances. Or take a deep dive into the Ocean Sea and swim alongside tuna, sea turtles and pelagic rays. Visit montereybay ­aquarium.org/animals/live-cams. Option 2: The Georgia Aquarium in Atlanta trains its lenses on nine marine settings and creatures, including beluga whales, piranhas, California sea lions and puffins, which are filmed from below to capture their tiny but bright orange feet. Visit georgiaaquarium.org/webcam/ocean-voyager.    Female lions, from left, Amahle, Shera and Naba relax in their enclosure at the Smithsonians National Zoo. (Skip Brown/Smithsonian's National Zoo)   Big cats  Option 1: The Indianapolis Zoo in Indiana is home to Amur tigers Maxim, Metis and Zoya. Tigers like to hang out by themselves, so you will typically see one at a time. When not napping  they are cats, after all  the tigers roam their habitat, sniffing out any threats or hunting for their next meal. To stimulate the cats senses, the zookeepers sprinkle scents throughout the area, such as powdered goats milk and perfume. The stinkier the smell, the happier the tiger. If the cats are hiding, check out the zoos other camera stars: Pacific walruses, penguins, macaws and long-tailed macaques. Visit indiana poliszoo.com/webcams. Option 2: Unlike tigers, African lions are social creatures. Six cats live at the Smithsonians National Zoo in Washington, and the three males and three females do not practice social distancing. Also check out the zoos other cameras documenting the giant pandas, naked mole-rats and elephants. Echo, a cheetah mom, recently moved her cubs into a den without a camera, but you can wait for her return. Visit national zoo.si.edu/webcams/lion-cam.    Grizzly bears Keema and Denali live at the Northern Trail of the Woodland Park Zoo in Seattle, Washington. (Jeremy Dwyer-Lindgren/Woodland Park Zoo)    Bears  Option 1: Wave a human paw at the grizzly bear twins, Keema and Denali, which live at Woodland Park Zoo in Seattle, Washington. Their habitat includes a stream and pool where the brothers enjoy trout fishing. (The pool is off-screen, so you will just have to imagine their fishing skills.) The staff disperses food throughout the exhibit for a tasty scavenger hunt. Though twins, a sharp eye can tell them apart: Keema has a light-colored patch on his side, and Denali has a broader forehead. Visit zoo.org/bearcam. Option 2: The Alaska Zoo in Anchorage recently removed Cranbeary, a female polar bear, from public view while the staff determined whether she was going to give birth. Baby season came and went, and the sugar-white bear is back in view. Watch her amble around her yard, which is filled with big bear toys such as a truck tire and garbage can. You might catch her giving herself a belly rub on a patch of snow. Visit alaska zoo.org/polar-bear-camera.    Primates  Option 1: With the San Diego Zoos ape cam, join the orangutan and siamang party that is often in full swing. The siamang clan consists of dad (Unkie), mom (Eloise) and child (Selamat); the orangutans include Satu, Indah, Karen and Aisha. If you see the apes crouching over a fake termite mound with a stick, they are digging for their version of gold: baby food, applesauce and other treats hidden by the staff. The California zoo has 12 animal cams, so you can switch it up with koalas, butterflies, baboons, pandas and more. Visit zoo.sandiego zoo.org/cams/ape-cam. Option 2: At the Utica Zoo in Upstate New York, the cotton-top tamarins are hardly camera-shy and sometimes peer into the lens. Dharma and her 13-year-old sons, Tom and Sawyer, are active all day, grooming, feeding and bouncing among the branches. They share their habitat with the more mellow rhino iguanas, Blackfoot and Stubby. Visit uticazoo.org/livecam.

92aaf400ba09d5f0024e8c429f20c3b1,How to think about planning travel this summer  and if you even can in the pandemic," Despite the all-encompassing disruption of the coronavirus pandemic, time marches on. April showers are still due to bring May flowers, and spring is still bound to turn into summer. For many, the arrival of warmer weather used to be a signal that vacations were just around the corner. People plan their summer trips months and even years in advance, usually without factoring in the risk of a global health crisis. But as the novel coronavirus continues to spread, where does summer travel stand? What the government thinks Earlier this month, coronavirus task force member Anthony S. Fauci told CBS This Morning that although he does not personally take vacations, traditional summer plans can be in the cards.  However, the nations top infectious-diseases expert continued that we have to be prepared that when the infections start to rear their heads again, that we have in place a very aggressive and effective way to identify, isolate, contact trace and make sure we dont have those spikes that we see now. [Follow all of our coronavirus coverage.] For anyone who had plans to take summer trips abroad, note that the U.S. Department of State is still advising Americans to avoid all international travel. It poses health and logistics risks to travelers. [Sign up for our Coronavirus Updates newsletter to track the outbreak. All stories linked in the newsletter are free to access.] Many countries are experiencing COVID-19 outbreaks, and implementing travel restrictions and mandatory quarantines, closing borders, and prohibiting non-citizens from entry with little advance notice, a State Department official told The Washington Post in an email. Airlines have cancelled many international flights, and several cruise operators have suspended operations or cancelled trips. Its not only international travel that could severely disrupt your plans. Because state regulations can change without much warning, travelers may find themselves having to follow new protocols like self-quarantining for 14 days on arrival. [How to secure a refund for a flight canceled due to coronavirus, according to the expert] What medical experts think  Government predictions and restrictions aside, its not yet clear whether summer travel will be possible from a health perspective. According to Gina Suh, head of the Mayo Clinics travel clinic, theres no easy answer. Summer vacation plans may have to be delayed to be safe, she told The Washington Post in an email. Travel often means congregating at unsafe distances, and that can be a risk. Also, your destination may be a major factor. The only safe answer here is to stay tuned. What travel experts think Like the rest of the world, industry insiders cant perfectly predict how the pandemic will affect our lives, let alone travel plans. Given whats going on right now, people may be reluctant or unsure of whether they can travel by summer, says Misty Belles, the managing director of global PR for Virtuoso, a network of agencies specializing in luxury and experiential travel. And the reality is that nobody really knows at this point. Until the government and medical experts say that its safe to travel, Americans should be prepared to postpone or cancel summer vacation plans  particularly early summer trips, as the end dates for state and federal social-distancing guidelines get extended. Id be very cautious of looking at travel thats going to be in June, but I would be optimistic towards July, August, says Roger Dow, president and CEO of U.S. Travel Association. Im hopeful were going to see a late-summer recovery to travel. [CDC extends no-sail order for cruise ships in new directive slamming industry] One thing is certain during the coronavirus pandemic: Americans are missing travel. Theres a tremendous pent-up demand, Dow says. People are getting a little squirrelly about staying at home, and theyre just waiting for what they think is a credible all-clear. While the future of travel is uncertain, travelers can still plan trips or fantasize about their next vacation, either practically or for an escape from anxiety.   This whole thing has sucked, but todayCancel Your Summer Vacation Daywas a real low. Bradford Pearson (@BradfordPearson) April 9, 2020   If youre feeling like you need a break from the news cycle, take a moment and pause and start dreaming about where you want to go next, and start the planning process, Belles says. Belles has seen Virtuoso pivot from booking immediate trips to focusing on ones that require months or a year of coordination. You now have plenty of time to really set up the plan to get the exact trip that you want, she says. You have the time to budget for it, and the availability is there as well. So its a really strong time to look for airfare and to look for availability in the cities or areas that often dont for the time of year you want to go. People who choose to book trips for summer or further out should do so with caution; the coronavirus pandemic is unpredictable. And many reservations may claim flexibility. Amid so much unknown, there will be one certainty: the headaches of rescheduling and canceling.

Abortion rights supporters said the changes put unfair burdens on women. A federal appeals court Monday allowed Texas to briefly stop abortions as part of the states coronavirus response, the most extreme shutdown of abortion access allowed by federal courts since the Supreme Courts 1973 Roe v. Wade decision declared access to abortion a constitutional right. The ban effectively ended Wednesday when the governors order forbidding elective medical procedures expired and was replaced with looser rules. A three-judge panel of the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 5th Circuit in New Orleans allowed medication abortions to proceed the previous week while it considered the matter, then Monday ruled that the state could ban medication abortions in response to coronavirus.   #g-abortion-virus-restrictions-box{max-width:980px}#g-abortion-virus-restrictions-box,#g-abortion-virus-restrictions-box

setup:window.setupInteractive||window.getComponent});   A federal judge in Texas had initially blocked the states restrictions, and federal judges in Oklahoma, Alabama and Tennessee have done the same. In Ohio, federal courts allowed a limit on surgical abortions to remain in place but preserved access to medication abortions. A compromise in Iowa created essentially the same result. In both states, surgery can be done to protect the life of a pregnant woman. Arkansas and Alaska have also restricted surgical abortions while allowing the more common medication abortions used early in pregnancy to continue. In Kentucky, Republicans led by the newly elected attorney general have sought to include abortion clinics in the prohibition on elective medical procedures, but the Democratic governor and the state Health Department have not done so. Mississippi, Indiana and Utah have discussed or issued restrictions but clinics remain open so far. The federal appeals court decision in Texas is based on the governors order limiting non-essential medical procedures. That order was set to expire Tuesday, the day after the federal court ruling. Gov. Greg Abbott (R) replaced it with new rules that allow procedures as long as sufficient capacity is left to deal with coronavirus cases. Abortion clinics have remained open saying they fit under the new rules. The coronavirus-linked restrictions have all followed the trend of recent years in which states in the South and upper Midwest have restricted or attempted to ban abortion, while states on the West and East Coasts have strengthened access to abortion.   #g-abortion-us-policies-box{max-width:720px}#g-abortion-us-policies-box,#g-abortion-us-policies-box .g-artboard{margin:0

setup:window.setupInteractive||window.getComponent});   This map portrays an assessment of the access to abortion in every state as measured by the Guttmacher Institute, an organization focused on reproductive health whose research is widely used. The institute evaluated a mix of standards for restricting or supporting abortion access, grading each state on a spectrum. Over the past several years, states that restrict abortion have increased restrictions, while other states have increased protections, creating a widening gap in abortion access. Guttmacher does not include a grade for the District of Columbia, said Elizabeth Nash, who oversees state issues, because Congress can override laws passed by the D.C. Council, and federal appropriations have imposed policies on the District.

80432ad4196cc34ac215d4b8a12e0216,"For the first time ever, DoubleTree has released its iconic chocolate chip cookie recipe"," Its not uncommon for hotels to make signature amenities available for guests to take home. You can transform your house into a vacation with touches like the Westin Hotels & Resorts Heavenly Bed, or the Ritz-Carltons destination-specific candles. Now, DoubleTree by Hilton is helping the world re-create its check-in experience by releasing the recipe for its famous chocolate chip cookie for the first time. The news couldnt come at a better time. While most updates from the hospitality industry during the coronavirus pandemic have been dark, the recipe release is a small but welcome flash of lightness. A warm chocolate chip cookie cant solve everything, but it can bring a moment of comfort and happiness, Shawn McAteer, senior vice president and global head of DoubleTree by Hilton, said in a statement. [A brief history of airline cookie drama, from Biscoff to Stroopwafels] With the exception of National Cookie Day (Dec. 4), DoubleTree cookies are normally reserved for hotel guests. That is, until now. The recipe yields 26 of the iconic cookies and calls for ingredients that may surprise you, such as lemon juice and rolled oats. Anyone allergic to nuts can omit the walnuts, the brand tweeted. And those intimidated by baking entirely can buy them already baked. The cookies have been given to guests since 1986, when the brand introduced the sweets as part of its turndown service. About 10 years later, the cookie instead became part of guest check-in and has remained a beloved fixture ever since, gaining extreme affection. It has this cult following, writes Stuart Foster, the former vice president of global brands for Hilton, in the book Talk Triggers: The Complete Guide to Creating Customers With Word of Mouth. For example, the hashtag #doubletreecookies has more than 5,000 posts on Instagram, with social media users posting photos of the amenity captioned with gushing praise. I just came for the cookie, one user wrote. Never not eating this cookie. If you know, you know, wrote another. Every year, DoubleTree hotels use more than 1,200,000 pounds of chocolate chips to make their treats, and more than 483,000,000 cookies have been handed out to date. To commence stress-baking, heres DoubleTrees once-secret recipe.

34f5b88cddb1b4660ea474efb931f8a8,This Peruvian take on beans and rice will remind you why the combination is such a classic," Overview Ingredients Steps  Overview Ive been thinking about beans and rice a lot lately, and its only partly because I wrote a book about the former. Ive been thinking about how the combination got me through some of my poorest years, when I was putting myself through college after my father cut me off financially. These were the instant-ramen years, but at least a couple times a week Id sit for hours at Austins Les Amis cafe (which we nicknamed Lazy Me because of the lackadaisical service) and eat a big bowl of brown rice topped with saucy black beans, salsa, sour cream and sometimes a little guacamole. I cant seem to remember the exact price, but it couldnt have been more than a few bucks, because that was about all I could afford. [How to cook a simple, flavorful pot of beans and use it throughout the week] That bowl of beans and rice became, on many days, the only thing I would eat. And it was satisfying and nutritious enough to see me through. Ive been thinking about all this as the coronavirus pandemic has devastated the livelihoods of countless people who will undoubtedly be looking, just as I was, for similarly cheap, nutritious dishes. I wrote a few weeks ago about how to cook a simple pot of beans and use it throughout the week, and one of the ways Im suggesting is indeed that classic combination  this time, made a little more interesting by way of Peru. Scale and get a printer-friendly version of the recipe here. One of the nations traditional dishes, tacu tacu, is basically pan-fried beans and rice. The bean of choice is the creamy canary bean (a.k.a. mayocoba or Peruano), and the main spice is aji amarillo paste (made from Perus favorite chile). But you can also use pinto or another favorite bean (especially if you made a big pot of them at the beginning of the week), and Tabasco or another vinegary pepper sauce makes a fine substitute for the amarillo. This often comes topped with steak and/or a fried egg, but its delicious and hearty on its own, especially with a crunchy onion salsa. Some Peruvian cooks fry individual portions in the oblong shape of an omelet, but I prefer one a large cake, which you can divide and serve as you please. It uses leftover white rice, but you can substitute whatever grain  preferably at least day-old and cold  you might have in your fridge.   Ingredients FOR THE SALSA CRIOLLA 1/2 small red onion, thinly sliced 2 tablespoons chopped fresh cilantro leaves 2 tablespoons fresh lime juice 1/4 teaspoon aji amarillo paste (may substitute 1 teaspoon Tabasco or other pepper sauce) 1/4 teaspoon kosher salt FOR THE TACU TACU 3 tablespoons grapeseed, safflower or other neutral vegetable oil 1/2 small red onion, chopped 2 garlic cloves, chopped 1/2 teaspoon kosher salt, plus more to taste 1 teaspoon aji amarillo paste (may substitute 2 teaspoons Tabasco or other pepper sauce) 2 cups cooked or canned canary beans, drained and rinsed (may substitute pinto beans, from two 15-ounce cans) 1 cup cold (preferably day-old) cooked white rice 1 tablespoon chopped fresh flat-leaf parsley leaves 1 tablespoon chopped fresh oregano or 1 1/2 teaspoons dried 1 lime, cut into wedges   Steps Step 1 Make the salsa: In a medium bowl, combine the onion with enough cold water to cover, and let sit for at least 10 minutes, then drain. Toss with the cilantro, lime juice, aji amarillo and salt. Step 2 Make the tacu tacu: In a 10-inch nonstick skillet over medium-high heat, heat 1 tablespoon of the oil until shimmering. Stir in the onion and garlic and cook, stirring, until lightly browned, 5 to 6 minutes. Stir in the salt and aji amarillo, and scrape the mixture into the bowl of a food processor. Wipe out the skillet. Step 3 Add 1 cup of the beans to the food processor and puree briefly until mostly smooth but still chunky. Scrape the mixture into a large bowl. Add the remaining 1 cup beans (left whole), the rice, parsley and oregano to the bowl and stir to thoroughly combine. Taste, and add more salt if needed. Step 4 Return the skillet to medium heat and pour in another 1 tablespoon oil. Add the rice-and-bean mixture and use a spatula to spread it around evenly and lightly pack it down. Cook until deeply browned on the bottom, about 7 minutes. Remove from the heat, invert a plate (preferably with no rim) on top of the skillet, and carefully flip both over to land the bean-and-rice cake bottom-side up onto the plate. Return the skillet to medium heat, pour in the remaining 1 tablespoon oil, and slide the cake back into the skillet. Cook for another 7 minutes, or until deeply browned on the other side, then invert the plate and flip the skillet over again to land the cake onto the plate. If the cake cracks or breaks apart, just pat it back together. Step 5 Top with the salsa and serve hot with lime wedges. Adapted from Cool Beans by Joe Yonan (Ten Speed Press, 2020).
